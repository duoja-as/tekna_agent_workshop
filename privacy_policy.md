🛡️ Privacy Policy – Spotify GPT Assistant

Effective Date: 2025.09.07

This GPT ("Mood Mix DJ") uses Spotify’s API to allow users to create playlists, browse music, and explore personal music data such as top tracks, saved songs, and current playback — all using their own Spotify account.

🔐 Data Access & Permissions

When using this assistant, you may be asked to log in to your Spotify account via a secure OAuth 2.0 flow provided by Spotify. This allows the assistant to access only the permissions (called "scopes") that you approve, including:

View and manage your public and private playlists

View your top artists and tracks

Access your liked songs and saved albums

Read current playback state (what you're listening to)

📦 Data Usage

Your Spotify data is used only during the active chat session to fulfill the actions you request (e.g., create a playlist, list your top tracks).

No Spotify data is stored, logged, or shared by the GPT creator or OpenAI outside of what's necessary to complete your requests in real time.

❌ Data Storage

This GPT does not store any personal data about you or your Spotify account. All access tokens and data are handled securely via OpenAI's GPT Actions platform, which manages OAuth flows and API requests.

🧠 GPT Memory (if enabled)

If this GPT uses memory to recall preferences or past interactions, no Spotify content is stored in memory unless explicitly summarized and saved by the GPT in user-facing interactions. You can view and manage GPT memory at any time in your OpenAI settings.

🔗 Third-Party Services

Spotify is a third-party service governed by its own terms of service and privacy policy. You can view them here:
